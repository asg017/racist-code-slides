# 5 ways to write racist code - Slides

This repository contains a [spectacle presentation](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle)
that is the slide tech for the "5 ways to write racist code" talk that I'm going
to give at [#NICAR19](https://www.ire.org/conferences/nicar-2019/).

I choose spectacle over google slides because I wanted to do special javascript stuff
that didn't make sense in google slides, and I choose the MDX boilerplate because
I thought it would be cool. On further reflection, literally everything I did here
was so very extra and unnecessary but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

If you want to run this presentation for some reason (god help you):

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

Then http://localhost:3000
